PROJECT WORKFLOW:
Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries
We began by importing all the necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning model building.

Step 2: Import the Dataset
The dataset was imported into a Pandas DataFrame to facilitate easy manipulation and analysis.

Step 3: Understand the Data
We conducted an initial examination of the dataset to understand its structure, data types, and summary statistics. This step involved checking for null values, data types, and distribution of various features.

Step 4: Handle Missing Values
Handling missing values is a crucial step in data preprocessing. We identified columns with missing values and employed appropriate strategies to handle them, such as replacing missing values with the mode or median of the respective columns.

Step 5: Data Visualization
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights into the data. Visualization techniques like count plots and box plots were used to understand the distribution of the target variable (Loan_Status) and other important features.

Step 6: Encode Categorical Variables and Split the Dataset
Categorical variables were encoded using label encoding to convert them into numerical values suitable for machine learning algorithms. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Step 7: Build the Machine Learning Model
A Random Forest Classifier was selected to build the predictive model due to its robustness and ability to handle a mix of numerical and categorical features.

Step 8: Train the Model
The model was trained on the training dataset to learn the patterns and relationships between the features and the target variable.

Step 9: Evaluate the Model
The model's performance was evaluated on both the training and testing datasets to assess its accuracy and generalizability. Metrics such as accuracy score and confusion matrix were used for evaluation.

Step 10: Confusion Matrix
A confusion matrix was created to visualize the model's performance in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This helped in understanding the model's predictive capability in detail.

Conclusions
Based on the dataset and model evaluation:
●	The Random Forest model effectively predicts loan approval with high accuracy on both training and testing sets.
●	Training accuracy and test accuracy is 1.0 and 0.756 respectively. 
●	The Random Forest model accurately predicts loan approval on both training and testing datasets.
●	 Key factors influencing loan approval include the applicant's income, loan amount, and credit history. 
●	Properly handling missing values and encoding categorical variables are essential for preparing the data for modeling. 
●	The confusion matrix helps assess the model's performance by displaying true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 
●	Created a Tableau dashboard using a given dataset.
●	The tableau dashboard helps in visually understanding the data and to get multi faceted view of the data for better understanding.
